## 🧩 Problem Statement

Database normalization is a critical process in relational database design, but performing it manually is time-consuming and error-prone.  
Students and developers often face difficulties in identifying functional dependencies and determining the correct normal form.  
There is a lack of simple, interactive tools that can automatically analyze schemas and guide users through the normalization process.  
DBNorm addresses this problem by providing an automated and user-friendly database normalization system.
